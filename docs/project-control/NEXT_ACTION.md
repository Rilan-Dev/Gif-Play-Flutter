# Next Action

## Current
Phase 2 — Temporary Download / Ready-to-Share Engine is **IN PROGRESS**. Phase 1 runtime/dependency verification remains recorded as pending and is not a development blocker.

## Completed development slices
- Phase 1 SQLite persistence foundation and repository-backed liked/viewed state.
- Legacy migration hardening and idempotency coverage.
- File-backed persistence/reopen test source.
- Repository cache-state primitives.
- Shared `MediaCacheManager` with cache reuse, bounded collection preparation, TTL, checksum, and byte-budget LRU eviction.
- Retry/backoff recovery with explicit expired/missing-file recovery.
- Cache maintenance cleanup without deleting collection metadata.
- Reusable `CollectionShareService` for single/multiple collection preparation and successful-share state transition.
- Existing `DownloadAndShare` normalized so remote downloads use `MediaCacheManager`; local files are shared directly without duplicate downloads.
- `CollectionShareService` registered at app bootstrap and exposed to the share utility.
- Reusable `CollectionShareController` added for collection loading, multi-select, readiness, preparation progress, and failure state.
- Focused regression source added for cache retry, cache cleanup, collection preservation, and collection-selection deduplication.

## Immediate next implementation sequence
1. [x] Add controller-level activation/close transition coverage and assert snapshot persistence.
2. [x] Repair startup restoration for invalid, closed, stale, and cross-Space detail-tab references; persist the corrected snapshot.
3. [x] Add database close/reopen coverage for Spaces, Detail Tabs, and SessionSnapshot; retain the existing v1-to-v2 migration test.
4. [NEXT] Introduce the visual Space/Detail Tab UI layer without changing the established persistence contracts. Inspect the current main-screen composition and integrate compact, horizontally scrollable Space and nested Detail Tab strips through the existing Provider/controller boundary.
5. Update the research index and project-control records when the UI integration changes the topology.

Runtime Flutter/Dart verification remains pending in the available environment; continue implementation without waiting for CI/Vercel/runtime gates.

## Execution rule
Do not wait for GitHub Actions, Vercel deployments, or continuous verification to continue implementation. Runtime verification must be recorded honestly when unavailable, but it is not a development blocker.

## Acceptance invariants
- A shared collection remains after its pending queue reaches zero.
- Sharing one collection never changes another collection.
- Duplicate media across collections reuses one canonical cache file.
- Failed downloads remain retryable and do not silently become shared.
- Cache cleanup removes cache artifacts/manifest entries only; collection metadata survives.
- Multi-collection preparation deduplicates selected collection IDs.
- Remote sharing has one canonical download path; no legacy direct HTTP fallback remains in the share utility.
- Collection items become shared only after a successful share operation.

## Do not do yet
- Do not redesign the entire home screen.
- Do not implement full Search 2.0 UI.
- Do not implement persistent Spaces/Detail Tabs UI.
