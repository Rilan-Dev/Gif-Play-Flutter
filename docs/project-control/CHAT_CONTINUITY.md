# Chat Continuity

## Purpose
A new ChatGPT conversation must be able to continue this project from repository-authored state.

## Read order

## Current handoff
Phase 0 is complete. Phase 1 persistence is implemented but runtime/dependency verification remains pending. Phase 2 — Temporary Download / Ready-to-Share Engine — is the active development phase and may continue without waiting for CI, Vercel, or runtime gates.

## Session-independent rule
Never infer completed work from a previous chat. GitHub files, Git history, and current repository contents are authoritative.

## Continuation procedure
- Re-read the files above.
- Inspect current GitHub tree and relevant implementation state.
- Identify the first unchecked/pending action in NEXT_ACTION.md.
- Continue from that action.
- Record meaningful work in WORKLOG.md.
- Update NEXT_ACTION.md whenever the next action changes.
- Update CURRENT_PHASE.md when a phase starts/completes.
- Do not close a phase without evidence recorded in the worklog and appropriate verification.

## Latest continuation point — Phase 2 item-level collection recovery
- CollectionShareController now tracks collection items and their cache/share states.
- Collection UI now exposes per-item Ready/Downloading/Not cached/Failed/Expired status.
- Failed/expired individual items can be retried through MediaCacheManager; a collection-level retry action is also available.
- Prepared collection sharing still marks items shared only after the platform share operation returns.
- Retry recovery has been batched so collection-level retry prepares only failed/expired items before one consolidated refresh.
- Focused regression coverage now checks failed-item recovery and that an unready preparation cannot mutate share state.
- The next implementation action is partial/empty collection handling, then the next authorized Phase 2 infrastructure slice.
